%\phantom \quad $\bullet$  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.965\textwidth} Conducted dissertation research on efficient  FPGA implementation of spiking neural networks in Research Centre for Integrated Microsystems (RCIM). Used different techniques such as Piece Wise Linear (PWL) approximation and COrdinate Rotation DIgital Computer  (CORDIC) to reduce the digital hardware cost and improve its speed  (5$\times$ faster with 0.5$\times$ area in some cases). The results of this research are published in prestigious journals.
