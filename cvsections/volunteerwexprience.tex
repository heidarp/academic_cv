 \phantom \quad $\bullet$ \begin{minipage}[t]{0.965\textwidth} 
 Responsible for designing high performance network controllers for Ethernet switches. The designed unit is capable of receiving, modifying, storing and sending Ethernet frames using innovative techniques. Simulation are performed to ensure validity  of design. Further, the designed unit is synthesized to study performance and resources. If necessary, it may be modified again to meet the criteria.
