Teaching Cybersecurity I : Introduction to Systems Security and Cybersecurity II: System Implementation in the department of continue education in University of Windsor. This courses are offered remotely where students learned about different types of cyber attacks and how to secure  computers, networks and servers. Course materials, attendance and quizzes and grading are done int he Brightspcae.

Closely supervising and mentoring two PhD and three master students on weekly meeting basis. Helping them to gain fundamental knowledge, identifying problems, literature survey for solutions, and critical analysis of published works. Both PhD students managed to publish IEEE transaction papers in their second year of PhD and have more papers in review and preparation. Master students are  performing research experiments at the moment. As a mentor, I provided guidance and evaluated progress of an undergraduate student to finish his project. \\[0.1cm]

helped students to formulate their ideas to flowcharts and further to codes to implement on FPGA, Arduino or Raspberry Pi evaluation boards
 and eventually debugging it.   \\[0.1cm]
