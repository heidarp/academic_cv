Dear Search Committee Members,\\

I am writing to apply for the assistant professor position tenuretrack position in the Area of AI for Hardware and Software Co-Design  (21$\_$T$\_$ECE$\_$M)  at Concordia University . I am currently a Digital Logic Design Engineer at NXP Semiconductors and a
 part-time research assistant in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Windsor.

My research contributions have been in the area of neuromorphic engineering, post quantum and homomorphic encryption circuit and systems.  
 During my MSc and PhD, I  have developed various novel techniques to improve performance  and  reduce the area of the systems implementing Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). SNNs are the third generation of neural networks which have numerous advantages over previous generations with wide range of applications  for classification and medical purposes. Such research was an step toward developing a biologically inspired neuro-processor.   As a postdoctoral fellow, I  started my research  on reducing  complexity and designing hardware for low-latency and low-area finite field  multipliers which are widely used in crytosystems.
As a part time research assistant in University of Windsor, I am working on designing efficient hardware architecture to implement Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Homomorphic  Encryption (HE) systems, as these systems are becoming  hot research topics due to threat of  quantum computers and data privacy and security concerns.  My research contributions  include seven journal, seven conference papers and one US patent. Furthermore, I have two journal papers and another patent under review and four more papers are in the preparation.

During the time working in industry,  I was involved in designing various System On Chips (SOCs). I worked as a part of team which designed an SOC which used artificial neural networks in cybersecuirty. I am currently involved in designing Ethernet controllers to be  embedded in cars and other systems. During these times, I acquired genuine insight into the requirements, development and applications of embedded systems in industry. I intend to bring such experience into research lab and classroom.
 
Beyond my research activities, I have been fortunate enough to obtain wide range of teaching experiences. Since beginning  of my PhD, I have been involved in teaching and preparation of course materials in several courses including: Digital Logic Design, Embedded Systems and Electronics.  As a postdoctoral fellow, I have closely monitored and guided two PhD students. I am also capable of teaching of the following courses with minimum or moderate preparation: Digital Logic Design, Embedded System Design, Digital Integrated Circuits Signals and Systems, Microprocessors, Digital Signal Processing, Electronics, Analog Integrated Circuit Design  etc. 
 My experience with outstanding teachers and advisers has made me realize
 how important one good teacher could be to a student. I tried to follow their path and work toward improving my teaching and research skills.

{\bf Research Statement: 
Designing efficient and high performance SOCs  Embedded system for emerging technologies
%A Neuromorphic Processor For Biological Neural Neural Networks
}
\vspace*{2\baselineskip}\\
%{\bf Background } 
Nowadays, embedded systems has became inseparable part of many modern devices. These systems include automobiles, UAVs, smart grids, wireless networks, medical devices, industrial controllers etc. With expanding to Internet Of Things (IOTs), it is expected that every device in the near future includes an embedded system. 

With expansion of usage, embedded systems face new challenges. An example is automotive section where self-driving cars require real-time processing which require very high performance embedded devices. Nevertheless, they require high levels of security, reliability and safety. Embedded systems in these modern cars also has limitation on power usage and usually must acquire various network connectivity protocols. Adding to the already long list, the resources for designing such devices is constrained and in most case, they need to be backward compatible. 


Addressing such challenges requires unconventional and novel approaches. In many applications such neural network inference engines and cryptography systems, the fetch and decode processors are incapable of keeping up with increasing demand for computational power, specially with approaching to the end of the Mooore's law. Same scenario also applies to power usage. An example of very power efficient  processing systems is human brain. A system which is intelligent, fast, fault tolerant and yet it uses fraction of the power used by Von Neumann computers. 

These research proposals aim to tackle these problems by developing non Von Neumann architectures. In this research plan, two areas where these new approaches are intended to apply are elaborated. \\
{\bf Case I: A biologically inspired neuromorphic processor: } \\
This research program will engage  students in studying learning algorithms for biological neural network as well as designing innovative high-performance, low-area and power-efficient  and  biologically plausible embedded neuromorphic processors.\\ [0.2cm]
{\bf Background: } 
%Over the past decades, researchers have been trying to 
%emulate and study the brain for both medical and information processing applications. Some medical objectives include understanding neurological and psychiatric diseases \cite{capecci2015feasibility}, 
%simulation of drug treatment \cite{wallach2015atomnet} as well as designing brain computer interfaces for people with sensory, motor and cognitive
%disabilities \cite{li2016collaborative}. Nevertheless, brain study is more important
%from an information processing point of view. The analysis of
%the brain's information processing mechanism can eventually lead to a new
%generation of computational devices  that are expected to be
%intelligent, power efficient and fast \cite{7378880,6145692}. Contrary to current
%computers, brain inspired systems will be more tolerant to both
%hardware and data failures \cite{6376255}.

%\end{wrapfigure}
Neuromorphic systems  include a large number of neurons, synapses and their interconnecting structure on hardware.  Such systems are highly parallel, fast, fault tolerant,  intelligent and
compact.  This research focus is on neuromorphic systems implementing Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). 
Spiking neural networks  are the third generation of neural networks where neurons communicate through sparse sequences of spikes. Comparing to previous generations, SNNs
are faster, smaller in size, more energy efficient and biologically realistic [1,2]. 

 Implementation of SNNs is computationally expensive because of
nonlinear expressions in neuron models, size of the networks
and various communication pathways.
% A simplified  biological neuron with its corresponding connections is shown in Fig. \ref{bneuron}. A neuron could be connected to hundreds of the  other cells including neurons and astrocytes.    
 This research objective is to address this challenges by designing efficient and high speed hardware implementation platform for SNN.
\\ [0.2cm]
{\bf Methods: }
%
%One approach to study   biological neural networks is to divide it into two
%hierarchical sub-levels of components and architecture. The
%components level, representing the lowest level of abstraction,
%involves studying and mathematically modeling the properties
%and interactions of cells within the network. The architectural level,
%however, deals with the complex interactional behaviors of
%a large number of inter-connected components. Activities that
%occur at the architectural level include learning and 
%information processing in the biological neural networks. 
%
%At the cell level, this research has two objectives; First, is analyzing the cells  differential equation and performing bifurcation analysis  to  optimize these  ODEs for a high-performance and low-cost    implementation. Second, is designing efficient circuits for hardware implementation of these cells. These two objectives are clarified further in the following.
%
%
Current neuromorphic research has led to the development of a plethora of models to mimic real neurons with different levels of abstraction in biological details [3,4]. 
%Biologically-plausible models such as Hodgkin Huxley \cite{hodgkin1952quantitative}
%describe cellular phenomena and properties of the individual
%biological components. Such low-level models impose more
%computation cost, making it difficult to simulate large-scale
%networks. On the other hand, biologically-inspired models
%such as Izhikevich \cite{izhikevich2003simple}, aim to
%mimic the biological neurons to the best degree of accuracy.
%Such models can reproduce most of the firing patterns of real
%neurons and are easier to couple to other spike-oriented units.
%Moreover, high-level Integrate and Fire (IF) \cite{gerstner2002spiking} is another
%computationally efficient neuron model, but it cannot exhibit
%many essential features of the biological neurons as observed
%in experiments. 
The choice of models depends
on the application of the device to be designed. 
%To perform
%computations with SNNs only a simple IF or Exponential
%IF (EIF) may be enough to act as a thresholding box.
%However, for research in neuroscience, biologically plausible
%models have higher flexibility in mimicking biology.
 In this research we intend to focus on
biologically plausible and detailed models and optimize them without comprising their  correctness.  

 %Second objective at cell level is designing practical circuits realizing these cells using hardware implementation techniques (e.g.
  First objective at the lowest  level is designing practical circuits realizing brain cells using hardware implementation techniques (e.g. pipelining and power optimization techniques).  It is very important to implement the cell
models as efficient and fast as possible since they are basic building block of the neuromorphic systems. 
Biologically plausible models are  relatively complex in nature comparing to high-level models due to their large array of differential equations and accompanying parameters.
As a result, they have  seen limited
proposed hardware implementations. Currently, there is no neuromorphic processor available for large scale simulation of the biologically detailed models. 
 However these models are gaining
more attention by researchers. 


At the architectural and software levels, brain cells are connected together through different interaction mechanisms and their systematic behavior is analyzed. 
%T
%his is useful to study biological functions and disorders as well as discovering computational algorithms underlying information processing, learning and memory in the brain. 
This research has two objectives in architectural level; First is applying brain inspired learning and information processing algorithms in the software level and second is  designing a configurable hardware for large scale implementation of biological neural network. \\
%In the following,  I will explain these two objectives in more details. 
%
%
%
%The exact mechanism of information processing and learning algorithm in the brain is yet unknown. However, 
%Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) is the most popular method  for unsupervised online training of 
%feed-forward  biological neural networks. This method is based on Hebbian learning where analogous to biology, the synaptic weight changes when a pre-synaptic neuron fires
%in a short time before or after the post-synaptic neuron,
%strengthening or weakening the neuron connection accordingly. Such a change is determined as an exponential of the time difference between two events. 
%
%Large scale hardware implementation of biological neural networks could be divided into two steps. First steps is implement nonlinear bio-chemical reactions between components and second  is to design an architecture to implement  various communication pathways.

{\bf Previous Research: } 
My M.Sc. dissertation titled ``Digital Implementation of a Concise Model for Astrocyte Calcium Oscillations" was beginning of my research in the field of neuromorphic engineering where I optimized a biological astrocyte for hardware implementation using Piece Wise Linear (PWL) approximation technique. Since, I continued to research in spiking neural network and neuromorphic engineering. As a PhD student, I started using COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer (CORDIC) method to implement Izhikevch neuron and on-hardware online spike time dependent plasticity.  The advantage of CORDIC algorithm over previous methods including PWL, is its very high precision to calculate nonlinear terms and yet it is well suited for hardware implementation.  
%In another work, a  digital implementation of a biologically plausible astrocyte and glutamate-release mechanism was presented.  
% The designed hardware was capable of calculating nonlinear functions with a very
%high precision while having relatively high performance. This is most important because, unlike high level models, simulation of biologically plausible models 
%due to high biological details requires long time and computational
%power and will fall behind the real time easily. This hardware is
%most useful to emulate the tripartite synapse and its components.
The primary goal of those researches was to find an appropriate hardware for neurons, astrocytes and other biological cells as buildings blocks of a biological detailed neuromorphic processor.\\
{\bf Future Research }\\
My future research plan involves
 both studying  algorithms underlying learning and information processing in biological neural network as well 
 designing neuromorphic processor for large scale implementation of such networks.

{\bf Case II: 
Post Quantum Hardware Cryptography and Homomorphic  Encryption}\\
%\vspace*{3\baselineskip}\\
This research program involves reducing complexity and efficient hardware implementation of the post quantum cryptography, homomorphic encryption, and homomorphic data processing embedded systems. \\[0.2cm]
{\bf Background:  } 
Cryptography systems have become  inseparable parts of almost every communication device.
Cryptography is  used to provide confidentiality, data security, and authentication in many applications such as
communication devices, autonomous vehicles, Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare [1,2,3,4] etc.


However, with rise of the quantum computers capable of executing Shor algorithm  [5], many popular public key cryptography systems including RSA  and elliptic curve cryptography will be no longer secure.  This would greatly endanger the security of digital communications and expose user's data. 
 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has already started a competition for developing cryptographic systems that are resistant to quantum computers attacks. At present, NIST has called for submissions for round 3 of this completion [6]. 
%The submission for previous rounds could be find in references \citecrypto{nistr2,nistr1}. 


Another issue with expansion of the Internet and cloud systems is privacy concern. 
 Currently, with the most secure communication between user computer and cloud system, still the data is decrypted in the cloud for processing. Therefore, the third parties owning the cloud and those with authorized access can read the data and use it for their own advantages. Homomorphic Encryption (HE), first introduced by Gentry  is a privacy preserving algorithm that allows valid computing over encrypted data without the need to decrypting it. 
 
 Since these algorithms are expected to be the future  cryptography systems, it is important to design an efficient  embedded systems for these systems. In next section,
 I further explain my methods to address this challenge. \\
{\bf Method: } 
Since  post quantum cryptography is a rather new field and because of  complexity of its algorithms, there exists only a limited number of the hardware implementations for these algorithms. 
 In this research proposal, Field Programmable Gate Arrays is selected as the initial implementation target since they provide a  reconfigurable, cheap and yet fast hardware platform. 
 % Round 3  finalists for public-key encryption, key establishment and digital signature are already available in NIST website. Most of these algorithms come only with a software implementation. Even those with hardware implementation still have plenty of room for improvement. This also applies to homomorphic encryption and computation as I discuss it further in the following. 
  In homomorphic encryption, plaintext is transformed into ciphertext, allowing computation on the encrypted data resulting in another ciphertext. Decryption of this ciphertext yields the same computation result as if it had been performed on plaintext.

%  (b) Fan and Vercauteren homomorphic multiplication over the ciphertexts (figures are taken from \cite{turan2020heaws}.)}
%  \label{hom}
% \end{figure}
% HE is based on lattice problems and adds noise during encryption. The value of this noise becomes greater each time an operation is performed on the ciphertext. 
% Somewhat Homomorphic  Encryption (SHE) scheme only allows limited number of the operations on the ciphertext and more than that, the signal to noise ratio becomes so large that the original data could not be recovered anymore. Gentry in his paper introduced use of bootstrapping technique which is basically homomorphic evaluation of
%the decryption circuit in the cloud to refresh and remove extra noises.
% This resulted into Fully Homomorphic  Encryption (FHE). 
 However, such  operations are computationally expensive and increases the complexity of the homomorphic  computations circuit. 
% Fig. \ref{hom} shows the circuit for homomorphic  encryption and homomorphic multiplication over encrypted data for  FV \citecrypto{fv} scheme. 
 Compared to software implementations, hardware cryptography results in a higher speed and a lower cost, while satisfying efficiency and low-power requirements of electronic
devices. Implementation of homomorphic encryption and evaluation circuit is a extremely challenging because of the very large word length of ciphertexts and computational unit, specifically multipliers. Homomorphic encryption  is a rather new research topic and its hardware implementation is less explored. In the following, I discuss my approach towards this  problem to achieve a better hardware for practical homomorphic encryption and data processing. 
%First, is studying the homomorphic encryption and computation to reduce their complexity and optimize them for hardware implementation. For instance, polynomial multiplication is 
%one of  the operations that is frequently performed over very large size operands (eg. 4096 coefficients of 180-bit size  ) and plays a key role in overall performance and cost of the hardware. Therefore, it is  important to optimize these algorithm as much as possible before implementing on hardware. 
%Second, is designing and efficient hardware architecture to encrypt and process data homomorphically. \\[0.2cm]
\\{\bf Previous Research: }
As postdoctoral fellow, I was working on the efficient  FPGA implementation of  finite field multipliers for Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)  where we proposed a new binary polynomial multiplication algorithm with low complexity and high speed.
The work was then extended to to hardware implementation of lattice based cryptography  algorithms and other post-quantum encryption algorithms.
\\
% Currently, I am closely monitoring PhD students researching in post quantum cryptography and homomorphic encryption where their research is focused on designing an FPGA based embedded processor for these algorithms.  \\
{\bf Future Research (Research Plan): }
My future research plan engages both studying and optimizing post quantum and homomorphic  encryption  and computation algorithms as well as designing an efficient embedded processor and processor for these algorithms. 
%Towards this objectives, I defined 3 projects.\\[0.2cm]

Further, I will use FPGAs as implementation platform to measure efficiency of design. FPGAs are substantially cheaper than designing  and fabricating a VLSI ASIC and have advantage of flexibility. Eventually, after testing design could be fabricated for final evaluations. Towards this objectives, I defined 3 projects:

In terms of funding , I would be able to use my background and familiarity with problems and concerns of industry to secure funding for the research. I have also experience of writing successful research proposal with industry partner to obtain MITACS grant. \\

%I was born in Iran,  in a city close to Iraq border, during the long and bloody war between Iran and Iraq. My parents had to leave everything behind and flee to  safer zones several  times. When I was three years old, there was a ceasefire and war was finally over after eight years. I don't remember much about the war; However, I could clearly feel and see the aftermath. There were people who lost their loved ones and were always sad, some lost a limb and became disabled, many suffered mental problems and most people, including our family, lost their home and all possessions because of bombings. This war, that left more than one million casualties and losses, was mainly over religious difference. I 
%deeply sensed and suffered from consequences of a flare up religious hate, and  as a child,  promised myself that never let hatred grow in my heart and I do everything I can to help people tolerate and understand each other.

%Like many, we lost our home during aerial bombardments. My father was a teacher and we were fortunate to have a source of income.  Still, economy of the country was devastated after the war. My father  could only afford to build a room in ruins of our house and there was no electricity or running water.   Stealing and street violence crimes started to increase   in a way that my father  had to walk me to school before going to his work. 
% It was not uncommon for my neighborhood friends to have a drug abusing parent, a single parent household,  or experience domestic violence.   Living under such circumstances were   difficult but it gave me a valuable experience and I  can still fully understand  how it feels to be financially insecure and live in a dangerous neighborhood.

%Later in school, I faced yet another challenge. Our city was a Kurdish region and I used to speak Kurdish with my family, friends and everyone else. However, the official language in the school and all textbooks were in Persian. Speaking Kurdish was forbidden in school and It was very difficult for me as child to suddenly start reading, writing and speaking a new language. I became fluent in the language, but moving out to other cities to continue education and subsequently finding a job where I faced more and more discrimination and
%humiliation because of my background. 
%
% As results of such systematic racism and being culturally oppressed, many people were ashamed to talk their mother tongue and begin to hide their ethnicity.  To fight this, I started a blog and developed android applications  to rise awareness that everyone has the right to speak their mother tongue and no body should ever be shamed of his race or background. My experience as a member of an
%ethnic minority has greatly helped me to better understand others who face similar
%challenges based on their identity.

%My commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion in academia is grounded in my personal experience. During my PhD in Canada, I was fortunate to work alongside insightful faculty members in University of Windsor. I was truly inspired by their commitment to social justice, diversity and inclusion. I became friends with people from  LGBTQ community.  Hearing their stories and experiences, and learning that some are still afraid to come out and be honest about their identity, reminded of my own experience as an ethnic minority. 
% I truly admired them and hope that one day no one experience stigma and discrimination because of sexual orientation. 
%  I have had the opportunity to address diversity and inclusion  in my roles as Graduate Assistant and Postdoctoral Fellow at University of Windsor. 
% I am committed to create an environment free from discrimination based on the race, religion, sex, economic status, sexual orientation, disability or other characteristics.
